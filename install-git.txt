-----------------------------------
Installing Git on your local windows machine (gives you command line functionality)
-------------------------------------
et Git from git-scm.com
All default options
"Use Git from Git Bash only"
"Use OpenSSH"
"Checkout Windows-Style, commit Unix-style line endings"
"Use MinTTY"
"Enable file system caching" (not selected - change later by setting core.fscache to true)

-----------------------------------
Installing GitFlow Extensions AVH (more command line tools)
-------------------------------------
*Download that doesn't allow the hacking*

The download is called Full installer for official Git for Windows. (http://bit.ly/T5ZMHE)
Extract the files and copy them in 
C:\Program Files(x86)\Git\bin 
OR (depending on your installation)
C:\Program Files\Git\bin

Open the GitBash command and find the download
cd /c/
mkdir GitHub
cd GitHub
git clone --recursive git://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow.git

cd gitflow
./contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install stable

Check if it's working (Gives a lot of errors about hooks and things - but it will still work)
git flow help


---------------
to set your account's default identity.
  git config --global user.email "richie.chauhan@gmail.com"
  git config --global user.name "udadoggdude"

Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

git config user.email "richie.chauhan@gmail.com"
git config user.name "udadoggdude"

I'm not sure exactly what this is used for. 
When pushing to origin (which gets set when you clone below) or clone from the URL then you have to provide the github url.

Initial Setup of Repository
-----------------------
After creating a repository on GitHub for Dogg-Tails I created a fresh folder on the desktop on Windows
*git clone https://github.com/dadoggpound/Dogg-Tails.git (this is a folder that only has a master branch)
*git flow init
Will create additional branch develop and is configured to automatically create feature, hotfix, support, bugfix as required with certain commands
*git push origin develop

-----------------------
Feature Release
-----------------------
*git flow feature start toc

Add a new file (I had modified readme earlier)

*git status
shows you what has changed and has been added

*git add index.html
*git add README.md

*git status
*git commit (Had to put in my user.email and user.name again for some reason - maybe I restarted the shell)
*git flow feature finish toc
*git push origin develop

----------------------------
Maybe install later
